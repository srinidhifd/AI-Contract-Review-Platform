# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Fix

## **Problem Identified:**
Railway couldn't find the backend code because it was looking in the root directory, but your backend is in the `backend/` folder.

## **âœ… Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Updated railway.json**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd backend && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Created nixpacks.toml**
This helps Railway understand the project structure and build process.

### 3. **Recreated .env file**
Your environment variables have been recreated in `backend/.env`.

## **ðŸ”‘ Next Steps:**

### **Step 1: Fill in Environment Variables**
Edit `backend/.env` with your actual values:

```bash
# Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here

# Get from MongoDB Atlas
MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/contract_review

# Generate at https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32
SECRET_KEY=your-32-character-secret-here
```

### **Step 2: Commit and Push Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy on Railway**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Your project should automatically redeploy
3. Check the build logs

### **Step 4: Set Environment Variables in Railway**
In Railway dashboard, set these environment variables:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

## **ðŸ§ª Test the Fix:**

### **1. Check Build Logs**
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Check if build is successful
- Look for any error messages

### **2. Test Health Endpoint**
```bash
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health
```

### **3. Test API Endpoints**
```bash
# Test registration
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123","name":"Test User"}'
```

## **ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: Build Still Fails**
**Solution:** Check if `requirements.txt` exists in `backend/` folder

### **Issue 2: Module Not Found**
**Solution:** Verify the start command is correct: `cd backend && uvicorn main:app`

### **Issue 3: Port Issues**
**Solution:** Railway automatically sets `$PORT` environment variable

### **Issue 4: Environment Variables Not Working**
**Solution:** Set them in Railway dashboard, not just in .env file

## **ðŸ“Š Expected Results:**

After the fix, you should see:
- âœ… Build successful
- âœ… Health endpoint working
- âœ… API endpoints responding
- âœ… No more Nixpacks errors

## **ðŸŽ¯ Quick Commands:**

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment configuration"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Check Railway logs (in dashboard)
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health
```

**Your Railway deployment should now work! ðŸš‚âœ¨**
