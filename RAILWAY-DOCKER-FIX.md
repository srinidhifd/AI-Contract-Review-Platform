# üê≥ Railway Docker Fix

## **Problem Identified:**
Railway is still using cached Nixpacks configuration and ignoring our changes. The old command `uvicorn backend.main:app` is still being used.

## **Root Cause:**
Railway is caching the old Nixpacks configuration and not picking up our new settings.

## **‚úÖ Solution: Switch to Docker**

Instead of fighting with Nixpacks caching, we'll use Docker which gives us full control.

### **1. Created Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["python", "-m", "uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### **2. Updated railway.json**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE"
  }
}
```

### **3. Created start.sh**
Backup start script for manual execution.

## **üîß Next Steps:**

### **Step 1: Commit and Push**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Switch to Docker for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Force Redeploy**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" button
5. Or delete and recreate the project

### **Step 3: Check Build Logs**
Look for:
- ‚úÖ Docker build starting
- ‚úÖ Python dependencies installing
- ‚úÖ Application starting with correct command

## **üß™ Expected Results:**

### **Build Logs Should Show:**
```
Step 1/7 : FROM python:3.9-slim
Step 2/7 : WORKDIR /app
Step 3/7 : COPY requirements.txt .
Step 4/7 : RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
Step 5/7 : COPY . .
Step 6/7 : EXPOSE 8000
Step 7/7 : CMD ["python", "-m", "uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### **Runtime Should Show:**
```
Starting AI Contract Review Platform...
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

## **üö® If Still Failing:**

### **Option 1: Manual Railway Configuration**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Click "Deploy" section
5. Set "Start Command" to: `python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

### **Option 2: Delete and Recreate Project**
1. Delete the current Railway project
2. Create a new project
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Set environment variables
5. Deploy

### **Option 3: Check Docker Build**
Make sure the Dockerfile is in the root directory and Railway can find it.

## **üìä Why This Will Work:**

1. **Docker gives full control** - No more Nixpacks caching issues
2. **Explicit command** - Dockerfile specifies exactly what to run
3. **Fresh build** - No cached configuration
4. **Standard approach** - Docker is more reliable than Nixpacks

## **üéØ Quick Commands:**

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Switch to Docker for Railway deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Test after deployment
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health
```

## **üîç Debugging:**

### **Check if Dockerfile is being used:**
Look for "Using Dockerfile" in the build logs instead of "Using Nixpacks".

### **Check if dependencies are installed:**
Look for "Successfully installed uvicorn" in the build logs.

### **Check if the correct command is running:**
Look for "python -m uvicorn main:app" in the runtime logs.

**This Docker approach should definitely fix the uvicorn issue! üê≥‚ú®**
